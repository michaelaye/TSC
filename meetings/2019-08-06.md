## Agenda / Notes
  - Elevator Pitch, [#17](https://github.com/planetarysoftware/TSC/issues/17)
    - What level of 'approval' do we really need for something?  The PR has 3/6 reviewers approving.  How do we decide how many reviewers are required?  Do we need unanimity, or just majority of approvers?
    - Some folks in that thread suggested text changes in comments rather than making edits to the PR, why?
  - Governance Docs need all kinds of work: [#18](https://github.com/planetarysoftware/TSC/issues/18), [#27](https://github.com/planetarysoftware/TSC/issues/27)
    - What's the way forward?
  - Project e-mails issue: [#26](https://github.com/planetarysoftware/TSC/issues/26)
  - Status of ISIS Technical Committee
  - Status of PlaneterayPy Technical Committee
  - Software Lifecycles under PDART. Can the TSC support NASA in some way?
