# Mission Statement

The Planetary Software Organization promotes open source software in the
planetary sciences by helping software creators and maintainers foster an
open source community.

The Planetary Software Organization Technical Steering Committee (TSC) helps
software creators grow and organize their community by providing a set of
ready-to-use community guidelines, standards, and governance documents.
The TSC also helps software maintainers manage the growth and evolution of
their open source software by providing mentorship and suggestions.
